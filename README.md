# PlayerProfileSystem_Prototype
Functional Version. 0.1 - Building a functional prototype of Player profile which actively tracks moral decisions and combat behavior- eventually will track other things about the player- allowing NPCs and enemies to respond to the players evolving identity


System Goals
PlayerProfile System (Version 0.1):
Track key moral and combat metrics in real time:
- Moral choices: Mercy, Cruelty, Deception
- Combat stats: Attack frequency, dodge/block usage, aggression ratio
- Rough skill estimation (Novice / Intermediate / Expert)

Manual Input Simulation:
- Use keyboard inputs to simulate moral decisions and combat actions for testing.

NPC/Enemy Reaction (Basic):
- One NPC or enemy reads data from the PlayerProfile to change its behavior:
-   Example: NPC trusts player with high mercy score, fears high cruelty.
-   Example: Enemy adapts based on player aggression or skill tier.

Debug UI (Optional but recommended):
- Display real-time profile values (morality, combat style, skill tier) for testing and observation.
